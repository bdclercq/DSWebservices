\section{Setting Up for the first time}
\subsection{Docker}
In order for this interface to work, a working version of Docker needs to be installed and running on your machine.\\
For this, please follow the steps found at \url{https://docs.docker.com/get-started/}.\\
Linux users will need to run the \texttt{install.sh} script to ensure a correct working.

\subsection{Creating the databases}
Once Docker is up and running it is time to make everything ready for use.\\
The first thing you need to do is execute the \texttt{run.sh} script on Mac/Linux while Windows users will need to execute the \texttt{run.bat} script.\\
When the services are up and running the user will need to open a second terminal and execute the \texttt{create\_dbs.sh} script on Mac/Linux or the \texttt{create\_dbs.bat} script on Windows. This  will create the necessary tables and also fill the database with all stops available at that time in order to prevent long loading times when using the app.

\newpage

\section{Usage}
After completing the set-up, the app can be launched by running \texttt{run} script for the corresponding OS.\\
Following pages will describe how the different aspects can be used.
\subsection{Home}
\begin{center}

	\captionof{figure}{Home screen}
\end{center}
The home page of the app provides a small description of what can be done in any of the individual tabs.

\subsection{Users tab}
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Images/Users_tab.png}
	\captionof{figure}{Users tab}
\end{center}
In the \textbf{Users} tab, users can register themselves by filling in their email address and a password they want to use throughout the system.\\
After submitting the form, the user will be taken back to the home page where a message will be shown telling whether the registration has succeeded or not.\\
Under the registration form the user can view a list of all registered email addresses in the system. This may prevent users from unintentionally registering themselves multiple times.

\subsection{Vehicles tab}
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Images/Vehicles_tab.png}
	\captionof{figure}{Vehicles tab}

In the \textbf{Vehicles} tab, registered users can add a new vehicle or remove an existing vehicle.\\
In this tab, registered and unregistered users alike can also see a list of all vehicles currently registered. By clicking on any vehicle the user will be taken to a page that will provide more details.

If a user thinks that a vehicle has been added with a wrong ID, that vehicle can be removed by clicking the `Remove' button and following the removal procedure.
